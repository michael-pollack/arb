Standard Arabic is described to have two frequent word orders; VSO and SVO. When the subject is definite as marked with the definite marker  ‘al-’, the other permutations are also possible,  although the SOV and OSV orders are marginally acceptable. 
For basic clauses with intransitive verbs with definite subject NPs, both VS and SV orders are possible.

In order to model this, we selected the 'free word order' option in the questionaire to gain coverage of all the possible word orders for basic declarative clauses with full Noun Phrases (i.e definite NPs that co-occur with the determiner 'al'). 
The reason for choosing sentences with definite NPs for the above is because definiteness on NPs constraint the word order possibilities. These are documented below. We allowed our grammar to overgenerate for the purpose of this lab, but developed the tests for these below.

As for the definiteness constraint on word order, when the subject is indefinite (indicated by the absence of 'al'), for transitive clauses, the verb must be sentence-initial. All other orders are ungrammatical. On the other hand, for intransitive clauses with indefinite NP subjects, the verb must be sentence-final.

############ Case ########################

Modern Standard Arabic has a nominative-accusative alignment case system. The nominative case is indicated by -u while the accusative case is indicated by the suffix -a. 

The subject is marked with "-u/-un”  which is the nominative suffix while the object is marked with the accusative ‘-a/-an’. Having the subject assigned accusative case while the object assigned nominative case render the sentence ungrammatical.
This is consistent for both transitive clauses and intransitive clauses.

Since the subject of the transitive clause and the subject of the intransitive clause have the same nominative case pattern to the exclusion of the object in the transitive clause, Arabic is analyzed as a language with  nominative-accusative alignment.

In order to model case, we defined nominative and accusative case inflection slots for nouns. 
The nominative case marker -u/-un constraints the nominal forms to be in nominative case and expressed as a subject of the main verb, while the accusative case constrains the nominals to be expressed as an object of the verb.

It is also observed that the logical object of the sentence can be expressed in the nominative case, only if the verb has a pronominal suffix.  
This constraint only applies to word order possibilities where the object is sentence-initial (OSV, OVS).
This pattern expresses topicalization of the object in the sentence. In these two cases, it is not possible for the sentence-initial object to be in accusative case, unless the pronominal -haa is absent, which is parallel with the OSV/OVS order documented previously.

To model this, we created verbs with pronominal suffix -haa and created negative test examples for OVS and OSV orders where the Object is expressed with accusative case in the context of this verb type. We maintained the use of definite subjects for consistency.
We also created negative examples for OVS and OSV orders where the object is nominative in the context of a verb with no pronominal suffix. These are also ungrammatical. We maintained the use of definite subjects for consistency.

####matrix wh-questions#############3

In matrix wh-questions, the interrogative wh- element is sentence initial, followed by the verbal predicate. The verb is followed by either the object/subject of the verb depending on whether the wh-question is the subject or object respectively. Unlike in declarative sentences with ‘free-er’ word order possibilities, Q-V-NP is the only possible order of constituents (Mohammad, 2000) for matrix wh-questions when the Q is a wh-word. In yes/no questions, however, other word order possibilities are possible with additional constraints, which we will turn to at the end of this section.

The wh- ‘who' is indicated by the word ‘man’. In the who-subject interrogative, “man” can be used independently to express the subject. But for the who-object. the wh-word ‘man’ can optionally  be used with a preposition ‘on’ to express the object. The ungrammatical examples refer to impossible word-orders that deviate from the sole Q-V-NP order.

'What' is indicated by 'madha', while 'when' is indicated by 'mata' and 'where' is indicated by '2ayna'.
The word order possibilities are identical to those of 'who', where the only plausible word order is Q-V-NP.
These word order possibilities are exemplified in the test suite.

In yes/no questions, the interrogative element is indicated either by ‘hal’ or ‘2a’, as shown below.

However, the alternation between these two elements are conditioned by two specific constraints; whether the yes/no question is negated, and whether the NP that follows is (indefinite).

The -hal variant can never be used when the yes/no question is negated (i.e negation is indicated by ‘lam’).
