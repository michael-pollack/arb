##### INTRODUCTION ##########

For lab 4, we focused on customizing our Arabic grammar to add Possessives, Declarative Clausal Components, Yes-No Questions, Clausal Modifiers, and Argument Optionality. We found in this lab several opportunities to address difficulties we were facing in labs 2 and 3, largely due to the pervasiveness of Argument Optionality in Arabic and the overlap of Possessives with phenomena that we had previously attempted to address with pronouns. We were able to achieve a fair amount of progress with our work this lab, though there is still more work to be done to address overgeneration and Clausal Modifiers, of which we struggled to find relevant examples for among our sources. 

In this write-up, we first discuss the phenomena we added, including the Test Suite entries and Customization Preferences we chose to explore said phenomena. Then, we explore the results of our work and what yet needs to be accomplished. 

~~~~~~~~~~ PHENOMENA & CUSTOMIZATION CHOICES ~~~~~~~~~~

##### POSSESSIVES ##########

In Arabic, possessives can be indicated using both a Genitive Case marker “-i” and a dependent pronoun, depending on the context. For example, when the possessor of something is not being referred to by name in the sentence, possession is expressed by a dependent pronoun on the possessum. In the sentence below the possessum is “criticism”. This nominative marked noun has a possessive marker “hu” that refers to a referent that is absent from the utterance.

# Possession, Genitive Case

2aqlaqanii ntiqaaduhu Zaydan
2aqlaq-a-nii ntiqaad-u-hu
Annoyed-3sgm-me criticizing-NOM-his.GEN
‘His criticism annoyed me’

However, when the possessor has a specific referent in the utterance, possession is expressed by marking the Genitive case on the possessor. For instance, below,

# Possession, Genitive Case

Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
2aqlaqanii ntiqaadu Zaydin
2aqlaq-a-nii ntiqaad-u Zayd-in
Annoyed-3sgm-me criticizing-NOM Zayd-GEN
‘Zayd’s criticism annoyed me’

Furthermore, when the possessor is the subject of a sentence and therefore would be marked with the nominative case, both the genitive case marker and the dependent pronoun can be used in tandem to refer back to the possessor. 

# Possession, Genitive Case, predicates

Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
Zaydun ma3ruufun binazaahatihi
Zayd-un ma3ruuf-un bi-nazaahat-i-hi
Zayd-NOM known-NOM for-honesty-GEN-his
‘Zayd is known for his honesty’

In order to model this, we created two possessive strategies: one using the possessive pronoun system and the other using a possessive strategy working in tandem with our Genitive case. For the former, we marked that our grammar features possessive pronouns that appear as affixes on the possessum and do not agree with the possessum in person, number, or gender. We said that the possessum noun can still appear with a determiner when marked with these affixes, but we do not believe this would be relevant as Arabic does not have overt determiners. For the latter, we added a Genitive case to our grammar and made a possessive strategy that adds no morphemes, but states that the possessor must appear in the genetive case, following the possessum. We said that this possessor acts as a specifier. 

##### DECLARATIVE CLAUSAL COMPONENTS ##########

There are three types of complementizers in Modern Standard Arabic which introduce subordinate clauses; ‘2anna’, ‘2inna’ and ‘qan’. ‘qan’ introduces a subordinate clause headed by a verb is specified for perfective aspect “-a”.  On the other hand, 2anna introduces a finite clause and what follows must be an accusative case NP.  In this documentation, we focus on the distribution of “2inna” and “2anna” that can only be selected by certain verbs. The selecting verbs for 2inna is verbs of communication like ‘say’, while 2anna is selected by verbs of cognition like ‘thought’, ‘believe’ and ‘knew’. They cannot be interchanged. Furthermore, for 2anna and 2inna, the subject of the subordinate clause that they introduce must be in accusative case. To demonstrate this, consider the following examples: 

For "2inna":

Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal complement, case}
qala	alrajulu 		2inna	albintu 		qabalat	al2lwalada

said-3sg.m DEF-man-NOM	that	DEF-girl-NOM	met-3.SG.F	DEF-boy-ACC
'The man said that the girl met the boy.'

For "2anna":

Vetted:s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {clausal complement, case}
Hasiba 	alrajulu 		2anna	albintu  	qabalat	al2lwalada	
Hasib-a 	al-rajul-u		COMP	al-bint- u	qabal-at	al-2lwalad-a	
Thought-3sg.m DEF-man-NOM	that	DEF-girl-NOM	met-3.SG.F	DEF-boy-ACC
'The man thought that the girl met the boy.'

For "qan":
Source: b:19, Mohammad, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal complement}
qala	alrajulu 		qan	alwaladu	yakula		altuffahata	
qal-a 	al-rajul-u		COMP	al-walad-u	yakul-a		al-tuffahat-a
said-3sg.m DEF-man-NOM	that	DEF-boy-u	ate-PERF	DEF-boy-ACC
'The man said that the boy has eaten the apple.’

In order to model this: - MC+/- for tdl editing, constraining certain verbs to select for specific FORMS of complementizers. We then added three verb types for each of these complementizers. Within each of those verb types, we added the verbs that would be able to take each of these complementizers as their complement. For example, "qal" was added to type trans_comp_2inna, "hasib" was added to type trans_comp_2inna, and both of these verbs were added again to trans_comp_qan. 

##### MATRIX YES/NO QUESTIONS ##########
For yes/no questions, the interrogative element is indicated either by ‘hal’ or ‘ʔa’.  However, the alternation between these two elements are conditioned by two specific constraints; whether the yes/no question is negated, and whether the NP that follows is (indefinite).

The -hal variant can never be used when the yes/no question is negated (i.e negation is indicated by ‘lam’). Consider the following examples:

Source: p:7, Btoosh, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
hal	namat		albintu 
hal	nam-at		al-bint-u 
Q.did 	slept-3.sg.f 	def-girl-nom.
‘Did the girl sleep?’

Source: p:7, Btoosh, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
2a	 	lam 	namat		al-bintu 
2a	 	lam 	nam-at		al-bint-u 
Q.did		not	slept-3.sg.f 	the-girl-nom.
Didn’t the girl sleep?	

As for the second constraint, it was initially mentioned that Q-V-NP was the canonical order. But it is also possible for this order Q-NP-V. However, if the NP immediately follows Q-did is definite, only the hal variant can be allowed. The definite article is indicated by the prefix ‘al-’ When this definite article is absent, the NP is interpreted as indefinite, and in this context, only the ‘2a’ variant is allowed. This is demonstrated in the following test suites:

Source: p:7, Btoosh, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
hal 		alwaladu  		qadima
hal 		al-walad-u  		qadim-a
Q.did		the-boy.3.sg.m-nom	came-3sg.m
Did the boy come?

Source: p:7, Btoosh, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
2a		waladu  		qadima
2a		walad-u  		qadim-a
Q.did		boy.3.sg.m-nom	came-3sg.m
Did a boy come?

In order to model this behavior in our grammar we added both "hal" and "2a" as question particles in the Matrix Yes/No section of the questionaire. We marked both as obligatory and stated that they occur clause initially and only in the main clauses. However, we were unable to determine how to model the behavior that indicates that "hal" cannot be used to introduce clauses with indefinite subjects. We will focus on adjusting this feature in our .tdl editing.

##### YES/NO QUESTIONS AS CLAUSAL COMPONENTS (TEST SUITE ONLY) ##########
Yes/No questions as clausal complements in Arabic use the particle "idha" instead of "hal" or "2a". The use of either of the two Yes/No question markers is, in fact, not permitted when the question is embedded. Additionally, "idha" must be placed at the beginning of the subordinate clause and the subject of that clause must be in the nominal case. Consider the example below: 

Source: q:19, Alsager, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {embedded questions}
talaba		alrajulu 		idha	albintu		qabalat	al2lwalada	
talab-a 	al-rajul-u		Q.if	al-bint-NOM	qabal-at	al-2lwalad-a	
said-3sg.m DEF-man-NOM	that	DEF-girl-ACC		met-3.SG.F	DEF-boy-ACC
'The man asked if the girl met the boy.'

This phenomenon was not included in our grammar for this week, though we have included test suite examples that we hope to model in the future. 

##### CLAUSAL MODIFIERS ##########

A note on Clausal Modifiers: During this lab, we had a great deal of difficulty finding adequate examples of clausal modifiers such as those equivalent to "while" or "because" in academic texts. We were, however, able to find information on conditional statements. Because of this, our test suite and modifications focuses primarily on these conditonal statements. As we continue our work in subsequent labs, we will continue our search for sources that discuss further clausal modifiers. For the time being, however, we chose to model based on the sources we could find and we will continue to adjust this section in future labs.

In Arabic, conditional clauses are marked by "2in", which is roughly equivalent to the English "if". Consider the sentence below:

Source: g:86, Alotaibi attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cl-mod}
2in ja2a aliun yafuza
2in ja2-a ali-un yafuz-a
If come-pfv.3sgm ali-NOM win
‘If Ali comes, he will win 

This modifier, however, is often accompanied by an additional modifier "fa-" that takes the form of a prefix on the following clause, similar to the English "then". There are a few different times when this modifier is necessary. If the second clause lacks a verb (e.g. Zero Copula), if it begins with a preposition, auxiliary, or adverb, when the second clause is a imperative, or even if the speaker is attempting to negate the causal relationship between the two clauses. An example of a conditional statement featuring "fa-" is shown below:

Source: g:120, Alotaibi attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cl-mod}
2in ja2a 2ahmadu faqum lahu
2in ja2-a 2ahmad-u fa-qum la-hu
If come-pfv.3sgm ahmad-NOM then-stand for-3sgm
‘If Ahmad comes, then stand for him.’

"fa-" can seemingly attach to anything but nouns. We were confused as to how to approach adding this feature to our grammar. After recieving clarification on Canvas that this "fa-" would not be considered a Clausal Modifier, we decided to omit it for this round, focusing only on sentences in its presence is unneccessary. 

In order to model this behavior, we added a Clausal Modifier strategy to our grammar. We said that it is positioned before the matrix clause, that it modifies an S, and that it is contributed by a free subortinator morpheme "2in" that serves as the head and in the initial position of the S that it attaches to. 

##### ARGUMENT OPTIONALITY ##########

Arabic’s heavy use of dependent pronouns allows for a great deal of argument optionality. In most cases when a pronoun is used in Arabic, it will appear as a suffix on the noun, verb, or predicate that it is modifying. For example, consider the test suite below:

Source: d:45, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
qabalanii Muhammadun
qabal-a-nii Muhammad-un
meet-PFV-1sg Muhammad-NOM
'Muhammad met me.'

In this case, the dependent object pronoun “nii” has been added to “qabala” to indicate that the object of the sentence is the speaker. Multiple forms of these pronouns can take place in one sentence, marking the subject, object, and possession, as shown below:

Source: d:45, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
2a3taytuhu qalamii
2a3tay-tu-hu qalam-ii
Give-1sg-3sgm pen-1sg
'I gave him my pen.'

This pervasiveness of dependent pronouns can result in entire sentences being formed from a single word, as demonstrated in the examples below: 

Source: d:45, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
ra2aytuhu
ra2ay-tu-hu
saw-1sg-3sgm
'I saw him.'

Source: d:2, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
qabalnaaka
qabal-naa-ka
meet-1pl-2sgmasc
'We met you.'

In order to model this behavior, we updated our argument optionality section to allow for both subject and object dropping to occur with any verb. We stated that the marker on the verb for both subject and object is required when the subject is dropped. We said that the marker is optional when the subject or object is overt, as we have observed some cases where this phenomenon occurs and we did not want to rule out that possibility. 

Following this, we added the dependent pronouns for subjects and objects to our morphology section. We allowed for subject morphemes to attach to any verb, and object morphemes to attach to any transitive verbs, including those already modified by subject morphemes. We marked all of these morphemes with OVERT-ARG permitted, to indicate that they are required when the overt argument is dropped and optional when it is present.

~~~~~~~~~~ OUR RESULTS ~~~~~~~~~~

After running our test suite of 145 items, we found that our grammar had overall coverage of 59.3% of the sentences that we included, with 37.3% overgeneration. A great deal of the missed sentences fortunately had to do with additional items in our test suite that weren't covered in this lab. Most of the items that we meant to adress were indeed covered.

##### POSSESSIVES ##########
Our tests for possessives seemed to go well. Simple sentences such as the one below were able to pass easily:

Source: d:2, AlQahtani, attested
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, poss, det}
zurtu baytahu
zur-tu bayt-a-hu
visited-I house-ACC-his
'I visited his house.'

Curiously though, the test suite seemed to have trouble with the genitive case, as it indicated that the following sentence did not parse:

Source: d:2, AlQahtani, attested
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, poss, det}
zurtu bayta muhammadi
zur-tu bayt-a muhammad-i
visited-I house-ACC muhammad-GEN
'I visited Muhammad’s house.'

However, upon parsing this sentence individually in the LKB, there did not seem to be any issue here. It seems that the grammar is parsing this correctly, but there is some issue with our test suite example or with tsdb. 

##### DECLARATIVE CLAUSAL COMPONENTS ##########
This section was very successful for us. It appears that all of our examples in the test suite here passed. The grammar correctly predicted all of our grammatical examples such as the following:

Source: b:19, Mohammad, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal complement}
qala	alrajulu 		qan	alwalada	yakula		altuffahata	
qal-a 	al-rajul-u		COMP	al-walad-a	yakul-a		al-tuffahat-a
said-3sg.m DEF-man-NOM	that	DEF-boy-ACC	ate-PERF	DEF-boy-ACC
'The man said that the boy has eaten the apple.’

It also correctly rejected our ungrammatical tests, such as the following:

Source: b:19, Mohammad, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {clausal complement}
qala	alrajulu 		2anna	alwaladu	yakula		altuffahata	
qal-a 	al-rajul-u		COMP	al-walad-u	yakul-a		al-tuffahat-a
said-3sg.m DEF-man-NOM	that	DEF-boy-u	ate-PERF	DEF-boy-ACC
'The man said that the boy has eaten the apple.’

In future labs, we will try adding additional test suite items for this phenomenon to push the limits of our grammar's accuracy.

##### MATRIX YES/NO QUESTIONS ##########
For our matrix yes/no questions, we encountered some expected overgeneration. Because we were unable to account for restrictions on "2a" being aplied to only indefinite nouns, we saw our grammar incorrectly parse examples such as the following: 

Source: p:7, Btoosh, attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {yes-no questions}
2a 		waladu  		qadima
2a 		walad-u  		qadim-a
Q.did		boy.3.sg.m-nom	came-3sg.m
Intended: Did the boy come?

However, the rest of our examples appeared to parse correctly. Similar to declaritive clausal components, we will attempt to push these tests further in future labs. 

##### CLAUSAL MODIFIERS ##########
We faced a puzzling issue with clausal modifiers. It appears that the grammar is correctly able to parse these sentences when there is only one subject, as in the case of the following example. 

On one hand, we faced another example of what appears to be a mismatch between our test suite and the lkb. For example, the following test suite entry was marked as not correctly parsed, but it appears to parse just fine when put independently into the grammar:

Source: g:86, Alotaibi attested
Vetted:f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cl-mod}
2in ja2a aliun qabala muhammada
2in ja2-a ali-un qabal-a muhammad-a
If come-pfv.3sgm Ali-NOM meet-pfv.3sgm Muhammad-ACC
‘If Ali comes, he will mee Muhammad ’

On the other hand, conditional sentences featuring two subject do not parse at all. For example, the following test suite did not parse in tsdb or the LKB:

Source: g:86, Alotaibi attested
Vetted:s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cl-mod}
2in ja2a ahmadu dahab-a aliun
2in ja2-a ahmad-u dahab-a ali-un
If come-pfv.3sgm ahmad-NOM leave-PFV ali-NOM
‘If Ahmad comes, Ali will honor him ’

This makes sense when looking at the parse chart. "2in" wants to attach itself to a VP, which then forms a PP that modifies an S. So for "2in ja2-a ali-un qabal-a muhammad-a", "2in ja2a" forms a PP, while the rest of the sentence forms an S. That means that when there is an additional NP, the grammar doesn't know what to do with it, and so it does not parse. Our challenge moving forwards here will be to modify our implementation of Clausal Modifiers so that they can attach to an S as well as a VP to more accurately model their usage in Arabic. 

##### ARGUMENT OPTIONALITY ##########

The addition of Argument Optionality was possibly our biggest breakthrough for this lab. This phenomenon is so heavily used in Arabic that a great deal of our sentences likely would not parse without it. 

The grammar is able to correctly add dependent pronouns to create shortened sentences such as the following: 

Source: d:45, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
qabalanii Muhammadun
qabal-a-nii Muhammad-un
meet-PFV-1sg Muhammad-NOM
'Muhammad met me.'

Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
2a3taytuhu qalamii
2a3tay-tu-hu qalam-ii
Give-1sg-3sgm pen-1sg
'I gave him my pen.'

The grammar was also able to add these pronouns in the correct order depending on subject and object, correctly parsing the first example below and rejecting the second:

Source: d:2, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
qabalnaaka
qabal-naa-ka

'We met you.'

Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn, wo}
qabalkanaa
qabal-ka-naa
meet-2sgmasc-1pl
'Intended: We met you.'

There is still work to be done here, as additional sentences were rejected in our test suite due to the adjectives attaching to prepositions that have not yet been implemented, as is seen in the following example:

Source: d:2, Albuhayri, attested
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn}
sallamtu 3alayhim 
sallam-tu 3alay-him
greeted-1sg on-3plmasc
'I greeted them.'

We hope to address this in future labs. 

~~~~~~~~~~ CONCLUSION ~~~~~~~~~~
We're getting the hang of this! 

This week featured a lot less of struggling with the software and a lot more of ironing out the phenomena we wanted to include. There were still a few bugs that we wanted to investigate further, namely the discrepancies between our LKB parsing and the TSDB results. Additonally, we hope to give Clausal Modifiers more attention in the future; we will work to find good sources for other modifiers, figure out how to get "2in" to attach to sentences, and eventually get the "fa-" modifier correctly attaching to the opposite clause. 

We were happy to see that our grammar is seeming to parse most of the sentences that we expect it to. We will need to work a bit to curb some of the overgeneration, but overall we consider our progress this week to be successful.
